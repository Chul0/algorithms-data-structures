// LOGARITHMS

// Rules of thumb
// The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than or equal to one.
// e.g. 8 -> 8/2 = 4 -> 4/2 = 2 -> 2/2 = 1 --->log(8) = 3



// O(log n) Logarithmic time complexity is great!
// Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms.
// Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity.
